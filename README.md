# Doomreader 📖🌀

**Doomreader** is an experimental document reader (EPUB / DOC / long-form text) that rethinks reading through the lens of *doom scrolling*.

Instead of fighting the endless scroll habit, Doomreader embraces it, turning continuous scrolling into a focused, frictionless reading experience designed for mobile devices and long sessions.

The project is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, meaning it works offline, can be installed, and is optimized for performance and daily use.
